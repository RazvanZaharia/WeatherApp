# WeatherApp
 - Is an app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice, 
 using the OpenWeatherMap 5 ( http://openweathermap.org/forecast5 ) day weather forecast API.

To run the project, all you have to do is to clone it in AndroidStudio.
Next feature I would do will be to track device location and show weather for that city. For the moment, the default city is London,
but user can input any city supported by the API. I would also add a city search history for an easier way to check the weather for 
different locations.
